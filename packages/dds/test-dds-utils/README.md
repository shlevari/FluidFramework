## Garbage Collection (GC) unit tests

[gcTestRunner](./src/gcTestRunner.ts) provides a set of tests for validating that the DDSes return correct GC nodes.

To write GC tests for a DDS, call `runGCTests` with a class that implements the following interface:

```typescript
export interface IGCTestProvider {
	/** The DDS whose GC data is to be verified */
	readonly sharedObject: ISharedObject;
	/** The expected list of outbound routes from this DDS */
	readonly expectedOutboundRoutes: string[];
	/** Function that adds routes to Fluid objects to the DDS' data */
	addOutboundRoutes(): Promise<void>;
	/** Function that deletes routes to Fluid objects to the DDS' data */
	deleteOutboundRoutes(): Promise<void>;
	/** Function that adds nested handles to the DDS' data */
	addNestedHandles(): Promise<void>;
}
```

The caller is responsible for the following:

1. Adding and deleting routes to Fluid objects to the DDS which is being tested.
2. Adding nested handles to the DDS' data.
3. Maintaining the list of expected outbound routes. The tests query this and validates that the GC data returned by the DDS matches these routes.

### Examples

[SharedCell](../cell/src/test/cell.spec.ts) and [SharedDirectory](../map/test/directory.spec.ts) have tests that use the gcTestRunner for validating GC data.

## Eventual Consistency Fuzz Tests

This package also provides a [generic harness](./src/ddsFuzzHarness.ts) for writing eventual consistency fuzz tests for a DDS.
This model is written using [@fluid-private/stochastic-test-utils](../../test/stochastic-test-utils/README.md).
See documentation on `createDDSFuzzSuite` and `DDSFuzzModel` for more details.

The harness currently supports testing eventual consistency of op application using Fluid's set of [mocks](../../runtime/test-runtime-utils/README.md)
including the reconnect flow.

### Cross-version DDS fuzz tests

The fuzz harness can run different clients with different DDS package versions without depending on any version-loading
infrastructure. A caller supplies exact version strings through `clientVersioning` and a synchronous `factoryForVersion`
resolver. The resolver must be backed by whatever package-specific loading mechanism the caller uses, and all exact versions
must be loaded before any fuzz test invokes it.

The harness records selected versions in generated lifecycle operations so replay and minimization do not depend on ambient
configuration. Load data also carries the producing channel's attributes, and loading paths pass those source attributes to the
target factory so cross-version loads use the format metadata written by the source client.

### Future Improvements

The generic aspects of this model could be improved to fuzz test correctness a few other general concerns DDS authors have:

-   Summarization correctness
-   Offline (`applyStashedOp` implementation)
